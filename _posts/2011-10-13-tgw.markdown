The Geek Whisperer is the website of one of Elenkos's founder, Catherine Kohnen. It's a place where she can speaks freely about her passions. One of those passion are the pinups, which is why I intended to work on the design based on colours relative to this age but also on images from this period. To play on the geek side of Catherine, I used some Space Invaders to find some balance with the pin-up image, and a robot toy. The font title was chosen in reference to Bewitched.
