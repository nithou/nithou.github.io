description: Wedding invitations for Simon & Nathalie wedding
---

I was asked by Simon & Nathalie to design their invitation for the best day of their life, their wedding. We designed together a small set of cardboard all tied together, with a calm and warm feeling. The design is really simple, playing only with colors, small forms and some icons for some part. I was really delighted to play a small part in such a wonderful day of their life and wish them all the best for years to come !
