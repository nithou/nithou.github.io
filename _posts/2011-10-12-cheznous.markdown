description: Website for Chez Nous, a small but great restaurant in Brussels, Belgium

Chez Nous is a small restaurant in Brussels, opened by two girls who do an amazing cuisine. The idea was to make a one pager with some warm feeling, displaying their art and their place. The back-end allows to modify simply some parts of the page, letting all the complicated stuff behind.
