description: Identity & webshop for Piment Plume
---
Piment Plume is a love shop not like just everyone else. Created by a couple who wanted to offer and experience of beauty & high-end products to the couples. They asked me to create an identity that evokes both **the sweetness and the more kinky / hot side** of the love shop. All together, after some tries, we created the global identity of Piment Plume, with a logo representing both of their sides (the feather & the pepper), and a handwritten font. The colors were chosen to represent both the **high-end** idea but also the sweetness of the loveshop.

The whole website was built on the same ideas, presenting **all the products** offered by Piment Plume but, especially, their special box for the couples. The box offers eight articles aimed to the couples, promising to spend some delightful times and to both **surprise and delight**.

The shop is now online and awaiting your orders, I can only recommend you to go there!
