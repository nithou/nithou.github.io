description: New website for Afschrift, a Law Firm from Brussels
---

Afschrift is a Law Firm founded in 1994 by Thierry Afschrift, specialised in every field of tax law in the widest sense of the term. I was approached by [Ex Abrupto](http://ex-abrupto.be/) to work together on a full redesign of their website to push them in the XXI century.

The website is of course fully responsive, but is also one of the biggest multilingual work I've ever done, available in 5 languages (including Hebrew). It displays the information in a clear and accessible way, and provides everything needed for an easy handling. It's powered by a strong system of page building allowing custom templates in every possible way and dynamic display of the informations.
