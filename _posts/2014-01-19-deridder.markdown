description: One page website for Eric Deridder, locksmith & glazier
---

Eric Deridder is a **locksmith and glazier** with 38 years of experience, who came to me to build his first website, a new way to **reach his clients** and present his services. We had some quick meeting to define his activities, and some key points and off we went.

I've looked many locksmith and glazier websites, and asked information directly to the users, to **get to know their needs** when searching for someone like Eric. This ended in building the website with, acting as a **call to action**, his direct phone number. His services are presented on the top of the screen, and more details are given below in the page.

On mobile, the layout stays almost the same, I only transformed the menu into a scrolling bar with a **direct call button**, allowing the visitor to directly call Eric.
