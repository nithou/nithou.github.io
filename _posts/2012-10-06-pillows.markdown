description: Identity work for Pillows Factory an Identity Agency I helped to create, oriented towards small companies

Pillows Factory was an Identity Agency I helped to create, oriented towards small companies, with a strong identity. When we created the global identity (with [Berenice Moldawski](http://be.linkedin.com/pub/berenice-moldawski/75/a10/53) ), we wanted to create a high-end identity, something the people wanted to touch, to feel.

We had the chance to work with strong papers from [Igepa](http://www.igepa.be/nl) for this identity, the **Macho papers** .Those papers are really heavy, and a lot can be done with them. So we worked with [Polyprint24](http://polyprint24.tumblr.com) to create those beautiful letterpress cards. They did a wonderful job on the whole identity.

We created all the identity using the Macho papers, from the **thick** papers (for the letters) to the **bold** ones (for the business cards), the only thing we didn't had the chance to make with it were the envelopes (unfortunately there were no Macho envelopes at this time, and the cost of creating them would have been too much). We used all the **three colours** available : brown, white & dark grey, using one colour by member of the team.

For the website, I wanted to give the same feeling as the print identity, something that **you'd want to touch**. So I worked a lot on the textures of the website, to reproduce the Macho papers. We also decided to use photos from pillow fights, with a little "retro" touch on it. The whole website had a real skeuomorphic feeling.
