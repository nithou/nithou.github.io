Badger Productions is the name of **Renaud Coppens**'s company. He's a freelance producer & director. He created Badger Productions in 2010 and came to me in search of a logo.

I started by submitting a few design proposals based on his requests and personality. Little by little, I refined the concept until I reached the end result: a **subtle play on the CSA symbols**, which, at the same time, relates to the universe of television and adds a **slightly off flavor**, a typical trademark of Badger Productions.

I then animated the logo and the name, playing with the graphical elements. You can have a look in this [short animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZUwR2t2Fs8) meant to be used at the end of his videos.
