description: Identity work for Matthieu Van Mechelen, a Belgian musician
---

Matthieu Van Mechelen is a belgian **musician**, passionate about sound creation & composition. I was asked to create a logo for his work (mostly great electronic music). He wanted something that would give a strong impression, and loved the idea of a hat (as in : couldn't live without ;) ).

<img src="../../img/works/mvm/mvm-concept.jpg" alt="Logo conception for MVM - Quick draw" class="left" />

So I started scouting around for some interesting hat forms, drawing a lot of them, to finish on some **mafia hat**, for its strong & groovy feeling, playing well with Matthieu's music. I worked with the [League Gothic font](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic), cropped by the hat, adjusting some anchor points of the letters to have a more "squared" feeling.

This font allows has a great readability, thus allowing the logo to still be **identifiable even in the smallest sizes**. Its weight gives also a strong and firm impression.

Variants of the logo were developed both in vertical and in horizontal, allowing a lot of usages. I also worked on a **single hat icon** for use in the social medias (like on [his twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Matt_VnM) ).
