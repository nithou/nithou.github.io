description: Business cards for Kevin Libioul, model from the Flag Models Agency.
---

A set of business cards I made for Kevin Libioul, a model from the Flag Models Agency.

It was the first time I had to handle that amount of informations on such a short space, but we handled it quite fine, displaying everything in a vertical format. I used the League Gothic font, from the League Of Moveable Type which is strong & clear.

Everything was printed at Moo which did a pretty fast and good job, and allowed us to use 4 different photos on the cards.
