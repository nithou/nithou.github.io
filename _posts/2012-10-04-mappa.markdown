description: Website for the Mappa Mundo, one of Brussels's greatest bar

The Mappa Mundo is the "traveler's bar", a place where you can chill out while having cocktails in a woody warm place, filled with souvenirs from all around the world. I worked a lot on those feelings on the website, using wood textures, and brown colours, to give some strong while warm identity.
