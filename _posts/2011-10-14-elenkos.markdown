description: Identity work for Elenkos, an IT & recruitment company with a twist
---

Elenkos is a company which offers different services in the IT field : recruitment, coaching, project management. We worked together to create an identity playing around this, using the power sign you see on your computer (yes you can have a look ;) ).

They developed a concept called business maieutics, created to help people and companies to grow in a positive and efficient way. So we wanted to give the logo some Ancient Greece feeling, by using both a font that recall this time, but also the cerulean blue.
