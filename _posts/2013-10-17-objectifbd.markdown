description: Identity work for Objectif BD, a Belgian website dedicated to comics
---

Objectif BD is a new Belgian website talking about comics (to which I sometimes contribute). As things don't always have to be complicated, I worked using some speech-bubble shape.

As I didn't developed the website theme, I had to analyze it to ensure that the logo could be included in it in a nice way. Therefore, I worked with the green color used here and there on the website.
