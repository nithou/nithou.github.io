description: Website & e-shop for Arma Cutis, a belgian brand for women
---

Arma Cutis is a **belgian fashion brand** for women, created by Alexandra Sebbag, a young designer. We worked together on this website, as she wanted something clear, minimal, but strong.

It uses my WordPress framework, [FortyTwo](https://github.com/nithou/fortytwo) which helps build a full responsive website on a solid ground. To give the website a strong personality, I've used a **video background** on the homepage, which made quite an impress.

The website contains a full web-shop, built on [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) (and tweaked quite a lot), and is quite easy to handle its owner. The ordering process is smooth & easy, allowing the items to be sold in an efficient & clear way.
