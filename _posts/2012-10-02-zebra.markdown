description: Website for the Zebra bar, one of Brussels's greatest bar
---

The Zebra bar is a nice bar in Brussels, with a **joyful green atmosphere**, which they wanted to be translated in the website. It has also a lot of animations, gigs, events, so they wanted a big place where they could announce all of this.

I had to include strong elements, representing its identity. I used the **same background as the menus** for the website and to add contrast, I included the **pastel colored chairs**, representative of the bar. To unify all of this, I chose a "handwritten" typeface. I also used big coloured splashes to render the identity of this **"little sunshine in Brussels"**.
