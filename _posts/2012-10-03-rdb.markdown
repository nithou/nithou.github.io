description: Website for Le Roi Des Belges, one of Brussels's greatest bar
---

Le Roi Des Belges is one of the "place-to-be" in Brussels, a wonderful bar filled with Belgium spirit and the Expo 58. I worked a lot on this website to give both a national feeling (by using our national colours) but also to give back this 1958 feeling (by using some nice illustrations done by their in-house graphic designer).
